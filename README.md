# InStock Website API
InStock is a Brainstation bootcamp project, this project took one week (one week counted as a sprint during the bootcamp).

The principal objective of this project was to work as a team, we had a Jira board with items to be completed, and then we had to go through the process of assigning points to the items, and then assigning items to each team member. The work was distribuited so every member could complete the same ammount of points for front-end and back-end tasks. So this being a collaborative task, it took daily standups, scrum masters being a different person every time, a lot of helping each other, and everyone working harder to get it through the finish line. 

The collaborators for this repo are: 
- Amanda Barret (https://github.com/amandabarrett)
- Graciela Manzanares (https://github.com/gracigraz)
- Jay Rodriguez (https://github.com/Jairo1031)
- Maria Gomez (https://github.com/mariavgomez)
- Alejandro Malagon Diaz (https://github.com/nescensanecati)

Week nine of the bootcamp was when the project was completed and the site was delivered for a final evaluation.

Nine weeks into the bootcamp, it was time to be more involved into using HTML, SCSS, JS, React, responsive sites, and a client/server structure.

The site was developed to be reactive and to change the format at three sizes:
- less than 786 pixels > then use mobile formatting
- between 786 pixels and less than 1280 pixels > then use tablet formatting
- more than 1280 pixels > then use desktop formatting

This API is using a frontend that can be checked in the Git repository:

The API was adapted to be run in production, and it is now running in Heroku, under the domain:
